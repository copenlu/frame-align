An Iowa woman named Kim Taylor was sentenced to four months in prison Monday after a federal jury convicted her last year on more than 50 counts of voter fraud as part of a scheme to help her husband in a congressional primary and a county supervisor race.
No matter what former President Donald Trump claims, actual incidents of voter fraud are extremely rare. Those instances that have come to light in the aftermath of the 2020 election are nowhere near widespread enough to swing a presidential election, let alone most down-ballot races. Taylor’s case, one of those rare instances, highlights one supreme irony of the GOP’s obsession with voter fraud: many of the cases of knowing fraud that have been prosecuted since then have had Republicans as the perpetrators.
Many of the cases of knowing fraud that have been prosecuted since then have had Republicans as the perpetrators.
According to prosecutors, Taylor helped fill out voter registrations and absentee ballots for members of the Vietnamese American community and their families in Woodbury County, Iowa. Taylor, who is of Vietnamese descent, took advantage of the state’s absurd law that all election material can only be printed in English to pretend that she was simply assisting voters with their forms. In fact, she was abusing their trust to increase her husband’s vote totals.
Taylor’s case is a real example of the sort of fraud that right-wing grifters have insisted is rampant among Democrats. In reality, many of those supposed cases are the entirely legitimate use of drop boxes and other approved early voting techniques in areas that lean Democratic. Other Trump supporters have been caught trying to vote more than once, including multiple residents at Florida’s retirement community The Villages. Still others have been caught trying to cast votes in the names of their dead spouses or family members, one of whom was initially a right-wing cause célèbre after claiming someone had stolen his dead wife’s absentee ballot. And just last month, a former election official in Milwaukee was found guilty of voter fraud for using her position to get obtain fraudulent absentee ballots and send them to a Republican state lawmaker who’d boosted Trump’s election lies.

More often though, we’ve seen that votes cast illegally not because of deliberate fraud, but due to constraints on voting rights for the formerly incarcerated. Crystal Mason, a Texas woman whose five-year sentence for voter fraud was recently overturned by an appeals court, testified that when she cast a ballot in 2018 that she was unaware that she was ineligible to vote. And since Florida formed its Office of Election Crimes and Security in 2022, most of its targets have likewise been people who’d voted after being told that they were allowed to do so only to learn otherwise when arrested.
Even on that front, Republicans have found themselves on the wrong side of these restrictions. Most recently, a judge ruled that Brian Pritchard, the first vice chairman of Georgia’s Republican Party, had violated state election law. Between 2008 and 2010, Pritchard voted nine times while on probation for a felony sentence, which is not allowed in Georgia. You’d think this might provoke sympathy or some kind of reconsideration of those restrictions from other Republicans, but his fellow election deniers have instead chosen to throw him under the bus.
The second deep irony of the GOP’s hunt for mass voter fraud is how much it’s detracting from the party’s efforts to win legitimately.
The second deep irony of the GOP’s hunt for mass voter fraud is how much it’s detracting from the party’s efforts to win legitimately. The recent Trumpian shakeup at the Republican National Committee put former Trump lawyer Christina Bobb in charge of the group’s Committee of Election Integrity. That committee was set up in response to Trump’s claims, even as RNC lawyers have warned against the kind of voter suppression activity that got Republicans barred from running “ballot security” in polling places from 1982 until just six years ago. It’s also undercut the real work of verifying election security, as multiple GOP-led states have withdrawn from the Electronic Registration Information Center, which helped prevent actual voting fraud as people move between states.
Those efforts at fearmongering about voter fraud are unlikely to bring in more Republican votes. That’s in contrast to the efforts to encourage mail-in voting — efforts that the RNC has recently shuttered. Officials who understand that getting people to lock in their votes early ahead of Election Day can make or break a campaign are facing enormous pushback, thanks to Trump’s lies. “I think Trump can win Erie County, but I have to get Republicans to accept the mail-in ballot,” Tom Eddy, head of the Pennsylvania county’s Republican Party, recently told NBC News.
That brings me though to a most disturbing conclusion: The insistence that mass voter fraud exists can be used by individual Republicans to justify committing voter fraud. After all, if the assumption is that Democrats are busy stuffing ballot boxes, why shouldn’t conservatives follow suit to supposedly even the score? And any GOP losses thanks to a lack of trust in early voting are more than likely to be chalked up to fictional voter fraud. It’s a self-sustaining cycle that would require real leadership from the top to counter. Unfortunately, there’s not much chance that Republicans stop projecting their claims onto Democrats, no matter how many of them get caught red-handed committing fraud themselves.",www.msnbc.com,The deep ironies in the GOP's war on 'voter fraud',,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/republicans-voter-fraud-convictions-2024-rcna146434,2024-04-01_2024-04-30,News

Sheriff David Davis said last week that Stokes, 52-year-old Joey Fournier, 24-year-old Marc Kerry Anderson and 37-year-old Johnifer Dernard Barnwell had escaped through a damaged window and a cut fence at the jail early Oct. 16.

Video footage showed a blue Dodge Challenger that had been just outside the jail hours before the escape and appeared to show someone tampering with the fence. That person then brought some items into the enclosed area, and the sheriff said investigators believe the items were used to help the men escape.
Davis said last week that it wasn't clear whether the four men left the jail in that car or in another vehicle or whether they left on foot. The sheriff's office said the car was found abandoned Friday in the parking lot of a Macon supermarket.

Tech mogul Elon Musk was blasted on Sunday after he posted a meme that mocked the requests that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made for aid to help his country continue its fight against Russia.

The caption said: “When it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars.”
Although the X-man probably thought the post was “comedy,” many people weren’t laughing, especially since as many as 40,000 Ukranian civilians have died since the Russian invasion began in February 2022, according to Le Monde.
As a result, Musk was blasted for the post, and many people noted that he’s not the guy who should be accusing others of freeloading.

You can invest in gold ETFs in the same way you would buy other stocks and funds. Getty Images
Where should you invest when inflation is high and the market is volatile? For many, the answer has long been in gold.
""Gold, in general, is considered a hedge against currency risk, and headlines seem to be blaring that America's currency risk is taking some dire turns,"" says Thomas Maluck, a Certified Financial Education Instructor.
But how do you go about investing in gold? If you aren't too keen on buying, storing, and securing the metal, below we'll take a look at how to invest in gold ETFs — and what gold investing experts have to say about them.
Start exploring your gold options by requesting a free investors kit here.
What is a gold ETF?
A Gold Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment security that grants investors convenient electronic access to the gold market — removing the need to buy, hold or secure physical gold. The underlying assets of gold ETFs vary depending on the fund you choose, but asset management companies often buy and store gold bullion (of 99.5% purity) and aim to track the domestic physical gold price.
Alternatively, some will buy stock in companies involved with the production of gold, such as gold-mining companies.
In either case, gold ETFs can easily be traded like stocks on exchanges, and their value will rise or fall based on the performance of the underlying assets.
Who benefits from investing in gold ETFs?
Gold ETFs give investors a convenient way to access the gold market.
""One of the chief benefits of investing in Gold ETFs has to do with the relative liquidity and portability of ETFs. If you build a position in gold through an ETF and decide a few months or years from now to close your position, you simply sell the shares and move on,"" says Maluck.
""Meanwhile, with physical gold,"" he adds, ""you have to find a seller, perhaps transport physical gold off of your property, likely pay a fee to a precious metals dealer, provide authentication for the purity of your gold, and so on.""
Beyond the convenience factor, gold ETFs are often considered safe-haven assets during times of geopolitical turmoil, economic uncertainty and inflation. ""Gold is a great investment for those looking to keep what they have and have their investments be a little more stable,"" says Patrick Di Cesare, a Certified Financial Education Instructor and the owner of Basic Financial Literacy.
Learn more about your gold options with a free investment guide.
What are gold ETF drawbacks?
While gold ETFs can be convenient and hedge against inflation, they fall short when it comes to returns.
Di Cesare says, ""Those looking to grow their money should look to the overall stock market like the S&P 500. When comparing one Gold ETF, OUNZ and the S&P 500, the S&P 500 wins by 1.1% this year. When you zoom out five years, the S&P 500 wins by 5%.""
It's also important to understand the expense ratio to make sure you're not losing too much to fees. ""Keep in mind that gold trust ETFs sell small amounts of their gold over time to cover expenses, which generates taxable events for you if the ETF is held in a taxable account,"" explains Maluck.
He adds, ""Precious metals are also taxed at a higher capital gains rate, including a long-term rate of 28%, much higher than that of stocks-based securities.""
How to invest in gold ETFs
You can invest in gold ETFs in the same way you would buy other stocks and funds — by using an online brokerage, stockbrokers, robo-advisors, etc. However, all gold ETFs aren't going to offer the same returns.
Be sure to consider factors such as the underlying assets, performance over the past five years, Net Asset Value, expense ratio, liquidity and tax implications. Most of this is available in each fund's prospectus or on the ETF's website of the SEC's EDGAR database.

The bipartisan tax deal that recently emerged on Capitol Hill does that and more, by both appealing to those voters and strategically positioning conservative values for future tax negotiations.
About the deal: this tax package, valued at $78 billion, renews tax credits for research and development for businesses, and includes a targeted expansion of the child tax credit that would help working families– all without adding to the federal debt.
Look across the aisle and see how some high-ranking Democrats are reacting to this deal. They view this bipartisan plan as favorable to Republican policy priorities. If you’re not convinced, a letter of support for this plan from prominent leaders in our party speaks volumes about its conservative appeal. Republican leaders like Missouri Rep. Jason Smith, who chairs the House Ways & Means Committee, deserves praise for his role in architecting this deal, since it not only provides immediate public value, but sets up Republicans for an even broader win down the road.
The current child tax credit (CTC) was most recently structured by President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I had the privilege of working on this law as a senior advisor to President Trump. It was briefly expanded in an overly progressive way under President Biden, but has since reverted to the TCJA baseline.
Many tax provisions established in TCJA — including the child tax credit — will expire in 2025. This deadline will lead to consequential negotiations a year from now on most of the tax provisions up for renewal.
The deal on the table shifts core components of the CTC to the right in two ways that will assist Republican lawmakers with negotiating on taxes in a year. First, the proposed expansion is more targeted and fiscally conservative than President Biden’s three years ago.
A key strength of the child tax credit is its effectiveness in reducing child poverty. My book, “Underserved,” lays out a blueprint for addressing the needs of the underserved communities in America with conservative values. Policy that promotes work and makes it financially viable to raise children like the CTC can play a part in breaking a vicious cycle that keeps economic opportunity out of reach.
We can achieve those benefits without furnishing wealthier families with a larger credit. This tax deal’s child tax credit would lift as many as 400,000 children out of poverty. Measures to extend the credit in 2025 will benefit from a tax deal today that can alleviate child poverty without runaway inflation caused by reckless spending.
Second, the expansion requires work to earn the credit. Families must demonstrate an annual income of at least $2,500 to receive part of it — that’s a forgiving hurdle to clear. It also makes it easier for families with multiple children to receive the credit.
Clearly this deal conforms more to the family values and original intent of the policy, as designed even before TCJA by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in his Contract with America.
As Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said in a floor speech, this CTC is “pro job, pro family initiative, and I actually think it’s pro-growth [economically].” Key voters for success in 2024 appear to agree: 60 percent of independents support a CTC expansion.
When paired with the Republican priority of renewing tax credits for American businesses, it’s clear how this deal is a win-win. That’s why 41 conservative tax organizations urged lawmakers to pass the business tax provisions included in the deal, as have just over a dozen pro-life organizations, which said that “few policy priorities [like the child tax credit] both enjoy bipartisan agreement and promise to make a significant difference in the lives of millions of American children and their families.”
This deal shows voters that the Republican approach to families and the economy will achieve what Democrats hope to, without causing long stretches of inflationary strain on family budgets.
It also showcases Republican-led innovation in America. The key business tax provisions included in the deal restore writing off expenses related to research and development, and allow businesses to immediately deduct capital expenses. This enables businesses to engage further in the innovation which creates American wealth and opportunity.
This is especially important for industries specializing in technology like artificial intelligence. Cutting-edge research has high capital requirements and needs more access to funds to compete with rivals like China. By renewing these credits for businesses, we’re putting America first and helping businesses compete with China.
From all angles, this bipartisan tax deal appears to be a net gain for Republicans and the America First movement. Conservatives should seize this opportunity and support it.

Yudith Matthews and Abram Mendez hired the contractor to complete tile work in their San Antonio home, but claim after they fired him, he refused to leave. He is now reportedly living in the house, but they said the police won't help.
They discussed the incident and recordings of confrontations with the squatter during ""Fox & Friends"" Thursday as the situation unravels into a legal nightmare.

""We don't have any protection. There's legislators that are out there, such as Governor DeSantis, who are making headway, but we need more headway across America to protect us, the homeowners, because there's very little,"" Mendez told Ainsley Earhardt. ""It's really a gimmick, I think, for the municipalities across America to make money.""
The contractor, who the couple said has gout, asked them if he could stay on the property while he was completing the work. They agreed and drew up a contract that he willingly signed.
Mendez said he videoed him signing their agreement, but the squatter later stole his phone and got rid of that video evidence.
They had anticipated the entirety of the job only taking a few weeks, but when the contractor kept making excuses as to why he couldn't do the work, the pair fired him. He then refused to leave the property.
""He must be homeless. He never, never even worked in the restroom,"" Mendez said. ""The first few days, he was complaining of his gout. Then after I was trying to get a work schedule from him, he would just give me runarounds.""

""Little by little showing that… it was a room. It was the house that he wanted all along,"" he continued. ""With our trust he abused us.""
Mendez and Matthews have gone back and forth from the constable's office and the police department but to no avail. The police allegedly told them the squatter had the right to stay at the house and the issue was a civil matter as opposed to criminal.
""They [constable's office] explained to us the rights to tell to the police, that is a trespassing matter,"" Mendez said. ""We explained the law, the letter and how to enforce it, and yet the police did not want to do anything.""
Even though the constable's office said the man had to leave within 72 hours, he refused and reportedly brought more of his personal belongings over to the home. They sought legal counsel as a result.
But things between the squatter and the homeowners continued to escalate from there.
They said the squatter shoved Matthews while they were putting up the eviction notice. They claim the police asked the squatter if he wanted to press charges and blamed them for being in his way.

Shocking video also showed the homeowners confronting the man, who told Matthews she was the one breaking the law, while he climbed through a window to enter her home.
""Squatters breaking into my house again through the window,"" Matthews said during the video. ""Squatters breaking into my house. Interrupting my work and recording me.""
""I can show you his rights,"" a woman with the squatter told Matthews in response.
""You are breaking the law,"" the squatter told her.
""I was recording him to have some proof of what was going on,"" Matthews said on Thursday. ""We called the police, and we didn't get any help from them. Instead, the police told him that he... has the right to stay [on] the property.""

The couple said the squatter had done just under $2,000 worth of damage to their property throughout the entirety of the process.

Mendez said he has spent hundreds of dollars just to initiate the eviction process, and argued the growing squatter issue nationwide is a ploy for cities to make more money.

A search and rescue mission was underway Monday morning for a submarine that went missing in the North Atlantic on an expedition to explore the wreckage of the Titanic. Lt. Jordan Hart of the U.S. Coast Guard in Boston told CBS News that personnel were ""currently undergoing a search and rescue operation"" when asked about the rescue efforts off the coast of Newfoundland.
OceanGate Expeditions, a company that deploys manned submersibles for deep sea expeditions, confirmed in a statement that its sub was the subject of the rescue operation, adding that it was ""exploring and mobilizing all options to bring the crew back safely.""
The company did not say how many people were on board the missing vessel or whether any of them were paying tourists, whom it does take as passengers on its expeditions.
""Our entire focus is on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families,"" said OceanGate, adding that it was ""deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to reestablish contact with the submersible.""

OceanGate recently said on its website and social media feeds that an expedition to the wreckage of the RMS Titanic, which lies about 400 miles southeast of the Newfoundland coast, was ""underway.""
Contacted by CBS News, the Canadian Coast Guard said the rescue operation was being managed by the Boston Regional Coordination Center, and a map showing jurisdictions for the various coastal search and rescue agencies off the North American coast shows the location of the Titanic wreck within the Boston center's area of responsibility.
Earlier this month, OceanGate said on Twitter that it was using satellite company Starlink to help maintain communications with its expedition to the Titanic.

""Despite being in the middle of the North Atlantic, we have the internet connection we need to make our Titanic dive operations a success — thank you Starlink,"" the tweet said. The company's website advertises seven-night voyages to see the Titanic wreckage priced at $250,000.
The company last tweeted about the Titanic expedition on June 16.
OceanGate's submersible, The Titan, is the only five-person sub in the world capable of reaching the Titanic wreck, which sits 2.4 miles below the sea surface. CBS News ""Sunday Mornings"" correspondent David Pogue joined the crew of the vessel, along with a small group of intrepid tourists, for a journey to see the world's most famous shipwreck last year.
As he got situated in the vessel, which he said had about as much room inside as a minivan, Pogue said he ""couldn't help noticing how many pieces of this sub seemed improvised, with off-the-shelf components,"" including a video game controller that was used to pilot the sub.

Klay Thompson scored 25 points with six 3-pointers, Andrew Wiggins added 19 points, and the Golden State Warriors beat the Utah Jazz 123-116 in the regular-season finale Sunday and wound up with the 10th spot in the Western Conference.
""We have a really good connection on this team, good chemistry, guys pulling for each other. So I've got a good feeling about what's ahead,"" Kerr said. ""I think we still have a chance to do something special. Now, obviously, it's NCAA Tournament, we've got to get out of the first weekend here, win the first two and get to the first round, but we have a shot, so we're excited about that.""
With the Lakers winning at New Orleans and the Kings beating Portland at home, Golden State will head to Sacramento on Tuesday as the No. 10 seed to face the ninth-seeded Kings in the Play-In Tournament. The Warriors won a thrilling first-round playoff series against their Northern California rival in Game 7 last year.

The Warriors will get on a bus Monday and have a day to prepare for former top assistant coach Mike Brown's team.
""It'll be a great a great atmosphere, we were there last year,"" Kerr said. ""They'll have their crowd behind them.""
Golden State only could have moved up as high as eighth if it won and both the Kings and Lakers lost.
Kerr rested Draymond Green and Stephen Curry, whose 74 regular-season games and 2,421 total minutes are both the two-time MVP's most since 2016-17. The Warriors are 1-3 this season in games missing both Green and Curry.
""He could have played. If we had to play him, he would be playing,"" Kerr said about Curry. ""Given what we're facing, it made no sense to put him out there today.""
Golden State, coming off a home loss to New Orleans on Friday night for just its second defeat in 11 games, utilized its third starting combination in three games.
Chris Paul started for Curry and finished with six points, six assists and four rebounds in 22-plus minutes.
Keyonte George scored 21 points to lead a Jazz team that went 31-51 — 10-31 on the road — and missed the playoffs for a second straight season. Utah won two of its final three games following a 13-game losing streak and stretch that featured 16 defeats in 17 games.
""We need to be rethinking everything,"" second-year coach Will Hardy said.
Jonathan Kuminga had a career-high seven assists as the Warriors recorded their 36th game with 30 or more assists dishing out 35. They have won the last eight home contests against Utah and swept the four-game season series from the Jazz.
